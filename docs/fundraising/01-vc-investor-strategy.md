- Unit economics (CAC, LTV, gross margin)
- P&L statement (revenue, costs, profitability)

- Sensitivity analysis (best case, base case, worst case)

**3. Executive Summary (2 pages)**
- Problem, solution, market opportunity
- Business model and unit economics
- Traction and milestones
- Team and advisors
- Fundraising ask and use of funds

**4. Due Diligence Data Room**
- Company documents (incorporation, shareholder agreements)
- Financial records (bank statements, financial model)
- Legal documents (IP assignments, employment agreements)
- Technical documentation (architecture, security audits)
- Customer contracts (bank LOIs, pilot agreements)

---

### 2.3. Due Diligence Process

**What Investors Will Scrutinize:**

| Area | Key Questions | How to Prepare |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Financial** | • Are projections realistic?<br>• What are the key assumptions?<br>• When will you be profitable? | • Conservative assumptions<br>• Benchmark against comparables<br>• Clear path to profitability |
| **Legal** | • Is IP properly assigned?<br>• Any legal liabilities?<br>• Regulatory compliance? | • Clean cap table<br>• IP assignments signed<br>• Legal review complete |
| **Technical** | • Does the technology work?<br>• Is it scalable?<br>• Security vulnerabilities? | • Working prototype<br>• Security audit<br>• Scalability plan |
| **Commercial** | • Is there real demand?<br>• Who are the competitors?<br>• Why will banks adopt? | • Bank LOIs<br>• Competitive analysis<br>• Clear value proposition |
| **Team** | • Can this team execute?<br>• Any gaps?<br>• Commitment level? | • Strong resumes<br>• Full-time commitment<br>• Complementary skills |

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Messy cap table (too many small investors)
- Unrealistic projections (hockey stick with no basis)
- Weak IP protection (no patents, no assignments)
- Team conflicts (co-founder disputes)
- Regulatory non-compliance (operating without licenses)

### 2.4. Valuation and Dilution Benchmarks

**Market Benchmarks (African Fintech Seed Rounds):**

| Stage | Typical Valuation | Typical Dilution | Example |
|-------|------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Pre-revenue (idea stage)** | $1M - $3M | 20-30% | Concept + team |
| **Working prototype** | $3M - $5M | 15-25% | Mari's current stage |
| **Pilot customers** | $5M - $10M | 15-20% | 10K users, bank pilot |
| **Early traction** | $10M - $20M | 10-15% | 100K users, revenue |

**Mari's Target:**
- **Pre-money valuation:** R40M ($2.2M)
- **Raise amount:** R10M ($550K)
- **Post-money valuation:** R50M ($2.75M)
- **Dilution:** 20%

**Justification:**
- Working prototype (de-risks technology)
- Tested physics seal (validated innovation)
- Bank LOIs (market validation)
- Strong team (execution capability)
- Large market (R870B addressable)
- Clear path to profitability (unit economics)

---

## 3. Pitch Strategy

### 3.1. Positioning: Infrastructure vs. App

**The Key Message:**
> "Mari is not a payment app. We're the payment infrastructure that banks integrate into their apps. Think Stripe for Africa, not Venmo for Africa."

**Why This Matters:**

| Positioning | Implications | Investor Appeal |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Infrastructure** | • B2B2C model<br>• Network effects<br>• Defensible moat<br>• Scalable | • Larger TAM<br>• Lower CAC<br>• Higher margins<br>• Exit potential |
| **App** | • B2C model<br>• High CAC<br>• Competitive<br>• Commoditized | • Smaller TAM<br>• High burn<br>• Lower margins<br>• Crowded space |

**Analogies That Work:**
- **"Stripe of Africa"** - Developer-friendly payment infrastructure
- **"M-Pesa 2.0"** - Next generation mobile money with offline capability
- **"Visa for Africa"** - Payment network that banks integrate

---

### 3.2. Key Metrics for Fintech VCs

**What VCs Want to See:**

**1. Market Opportunity**
- Total Addressable Market (TAM): **R870B in SA, R9.2B across Africa**
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): **32M banked smartphone users in SA**
- Target market share: **15% by Year 5**

**2. Unit Economics**
- Revenue per user: **R24/year** (20 transactions/month × R0.10)
- Cost per user: **R6/year** (infrastructure)
- Gross profit per user: **R18/year**
- Gross margin: **75%**
- LTV/CAC ratio: **30x** (excellent)

**3. Fraud Reduction (Unique Selling Point)**

- Fraud reduction: **80-90%** vs current methods
- Bank savings: **R35M per 1M transactions**
- Instant authorization: **<2 seconds** (vs 1-3 days)

**4. Growth Projections**

---

### 3.3. Handling Common Objections

**Objection 1: "How do you compete with M-Pesa / banks / Stripe?"**

**Response:**
> "We're not competing - we're complementing. M-Pesa is dominant in Kenya but hasn't cracked South Africa. Banks have the customers but lack the technology for instant, fraud-proof payments. Stripe is global but not built for Africa's offline reality. Mari is the missing infrastructure layer that makes all of them better."

**Key Points:**
- Different positioning (infrastructure, not app)
- Unique technology (physics seal)
- Local focus (offline capability, SA regulations)
- Partnership model (not competitive)

---

**Objection 2: "What about regulatory risk?"**

**Response:**
> "We've designed Mari to work within the existing regulatory framework, not around it. By partnering with banks, we leverage their existing licenses and compliance infrastructure. Our advisor, Dr. Godfrey Shekede (former Bank of England), is guiding our regulatory strategy. We're applying for SARB sandbox approval in Month 6."

**Key Points:**
- Bank partnership model (leverage their licenses)
- Experienced advisor (Dr. Shekede)
- Proactive engagement (SARB sandbox)
- Compliance-first approach (FICA, POPIA built-in)

---

**Objection 3: "Can your team execute?"**

**Response:**
> "We have the perfect team for this challenge. Nyasha (CTO) has built the working prototype and tested the physics seal. Diba (Chief AI Officer) brings insider knowledge from FNB and will lead bank integrations. Cebo (Chief Business Officer) handles data and operations. Dr. Shekede (advisor) provides regulatory and strategic guidance from his Bank of England experience. We're not just talking - we've already built and validated the core technology."

**Key Points:**
- Complementary skills (tech, banking, business, strategy)
- Proven execution (working prototype)
- Insider advantage (Diba's FNB connection)
- Strategic guidance (Dr. Shekede's credibility)
