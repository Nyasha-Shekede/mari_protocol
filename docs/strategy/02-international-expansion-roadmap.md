# Mari International Expansion Roadmap

## TL;DR: Africa First, Then Global

**Phase 1 (Years 1-2): Dominate South Africa** (5M users)
**Phase 2 (Years 2-3): Expand to SADC** (15M users)
**Phase 3 (Years 3-5): Pan-African** (50M users)
**Phase 4 (Years 5-7): Emerging Markets** (200M users)
**Phase 5 (Years 7-10): Global** (1B users)

---

## The Strategy: Build While You Expand

**Key insight: Don't wait to conquer South Africa before expanding**

**Why expand early:**
1. **Network effects across borders** (remittances)
2. **Regulatory diversification** (not dependent on one country)
3. **Competitive moats** (lock in multiple markets)
4. **Revenue diversification** (multiple revenue streams)
5. **Talent acquisition** (attract global talent)

**The playbook:**
```
Year 1: Launch South Africa
Year 1.5: Launch Nigeria (while scaling SA)
Year 2: Launch Kenya (while scaling SA + Nigeria)
Year 2.5: Launch Ghana (while scaling all three)
Year 3: Launch 5 more African countries
Year 4: Launch 10 more African countries
Year 5: Launch emerging markets (India, Brazil, Indonesia)
```

**Parallel execution, not sequential**

## Cross-Border Payments: The Killer Feature

### Why Cross-Border Matters

**Remittance market:**
```
Global remittances: $700B/year
Africa remittances: $100B/year
Average fee: 8% (World Bank data)
Total fees: $8B/year

Mari's opportunity:
- Lower fees (2% vs 8%)
- Instant settlement (vs 1-3 days)
- Physics-secured (vs fraud-prone)

Potential capture: 20% of Africa remittances = $20B/year
Mari's revenue (2% fee): $400M/year
```

**Key corridors:**
```
1. South Africa → Zimbabwe: $1B/year
2. South Africa → Mozambique: $500M/year
3. USA → Nigeria: $25B/year
4. UK → Ghana: $3B/year
5. UAE → Kenya: $2B/year
```

### How Cross-Border Works

**Scenario: Alice (South Africa) sends R1,000 to Bob (Zimbabwe)**

```
Step 1: Alice initiates payment
- Opens Mari app
- Enters Bob's phone number (+263...)
- Enters amount (R1,000)
- Shakes phone (physics seal)

Step 2: Mari converts currency
- R1,000 ZAR = $55 USD = $55 × 25 = 1,375 ZWL
- Exchange rate: Real-time, mid-market
- Fee: 2% (R20)
- Bob receives: 1,375 ZWL

Step 3: Settlement
- Alice's Mari account (ZAR): -R1,020
- Bob's Mari account (ZWL): +1,375 ZWL
- Instant (2 seconds)

Step 4: Mari settles with banks
- Mari's SA bank: -R1,000
- Mari's Zimbabwe bank: +1,375 ZWL
- Settlement: End of day (batch)
```

**User experience:**
- Instant (2 seconds)
- Cheap (2% vs 8%)
- Simple (phone number only)
- Secure (physics seal)

---

## The Technology: Built for Global Scale

### Multi-Currency Support

**Architecture:**
```
User accounts:
- Alice (South Africa): R1,000 ZAR
- Bob (Nigeria): ₦50,000 NGN
- Carol (Kenya): KSh10,000 KES

Mari ledger:
- Stores balances in local currency
- Converts on-the-fly for cross-border
- Uses real-time exchange rates (Wise API)
```

**Database schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_balances (
    user_id UUID,
    currency VARCHAR(3),  -- ZAR, NGN, KES, etc.
    balance DECIMAL(15,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, currency)
);

-- Example:
-- Alice: (550e8400, 'ZAR', 1000.00)
-- Bob:   (660e8400, 'NGN', 50000.00)
-- Carol: (770e8400, 'KES', 10000.00)
```

## The Bottom Line

**Don't wait to conquer South Africa before expanding:**

**The strategy:**
1. **Year 1**: Launch South Africa (prove model)
2. **Year 1.5**: Launch Nigeria (parallel expansion)
3. **Year 2**: Launch Kenya, Botswana, Namibia (scale)
4. **Year 3**: Launch 5 more African countries (dominate Africa)
5. **Year 5**: Launch India, Brazil, Indonesia (prove global scalability)
6. **Year 7**: Launch Europe, USA (global domination)

**Why parallel expansion works:**
- Network effects across borders (remittances)
- Regulatory diversification (not dependent on one country)
- Competitive moats (lock in multiple markets)
- Revenue diversification (multiple revenue streams)
- Talent acquisition (attract global talent)

**The numbers:**
- Year 5: 98M users (Africa), R9.2B revenue, R92B valuation
- Year 7: 263M users (Africa + Emerging), R31.2B revenue, R312B valuation
- Year 10: 463M users (Global), R136.2B revenue, R1.36T valuation

**Comparison:**
- M-Pesa: 30M users, $5B valuation (Africa only)
- PayPal: 400M users, $70B valuation (Global)
- Mari potential: 463M users, $75B valuation (Global)

**The vision: Mari becomes the global payment protocol, starting in Africa.**

**Build while you expand. Scale while you learn. Dominate while you grow.**

**Let's fucking do this.**
