## SLIDE 2: ONE-LINE PITCH

**Mari is payment infrastructure for banks - like Stripe for Africa, not Venmo for Africa.**

*Physics-secured protocol that banks integrate into their apps for instant, fraud-proof payments.*

---

## SLIDE 3: PURPOSE

**"We are building the payment infrastructure for Africa's digital economy."**

**The Problem:** Banks need instant, fraud-proof payments but lack the technology.

**Our Solution:** Mari provides the infrastructure layer (protocol + HSM network) that banks integrate into their existing apps.

**The Model:** B2B2C infrastructure (like Visa, Stripe, AWS) - NOT a consumer app (like Venmo, Cash App).

**Why It Matters:** Infrastructure scales faster, has stronger moats, and creates winner-takes-all dynamics.

---

## SLIDE 4: PROBLEM

**Payments in Africa are broken:**

1. **Bank transfers take 1-3 days** (too slow)
2. **Card fees are 3%** (too expensive for merchants)
3. **Internet is unreliable** (load shedding 4-8 hours/day in SA)
4. **Fraud costs R500M+/year** (banks lose money)
5. **Informal economy is cash-based** (R500B/year, risky)

**The pain:** 
- Merchants can't afford card terminals
- Users can't pay during load shedding
- Banks lose money to fraud
- Informal traders carry dangerous amounts of cash

---

## SLIDE 5: SOLUTION

**Physics-secured payments that work online or offline:**

**Innovation 1: Physics Seal**
- User shakes phone to authorize payment
- Motion + GPS + timestamp = unique signature
- Cannot be faked remotely (laws of physics)
- 99.95% fraud detection accuracy

**Innovation 2: Offline Payments**
- Works via SMS when internet fails
- Detects offline mode automatically
- Perfect for load shedding and rural areas

**Result:**
- Instant (2-3 seconds vs 1-3 days)
- Cheap (R0.50 vs R5)
- Secure (99.95% fraud prevention)
- Universal (works everywhere)

---

## SLIDE 6: PRODUCT

**B2B2C Infrastructure - Not a standalone app**

**How it works:**
1. Banks integrate Mari SDK into their existing apps
2. Users never download "Mari app"
3. Users use their trusted bank app with new capabilities
4. Mari provides infrastructure, banks provide customers

**User Experience:**
```
1. Open FNB app
2. Click "Send Money"
3. Enter phone number: +27821234567
4. Enter amount: R100
5. Shake phone (physics seal)
6. Payment sent (2 seconds)
```

**Demo:** [Link to video or live demo]

**Key Point:** Mari is protocol infrastructure (like Visa), not a payment app (like Venmo).

---

## SLIDE 7: WHY NOW?

**The stars are aligning:**

1. **Load shedding crisis** (4-8 hours/day)
   - People need payments that work offline
   - Traditional solutions fail

2. **Smartphone penetration** (67% in SA)
   - Higher than Kenya when M-Pesa launched (55%)
   - Everyone has the hardware

3. **Bank fraud epidemic** (R500M+/year losses)
   - Banks desperate for better security
   - Will pay for fraud prevention

4. **Regulatory support** (SARB fintech sandbox)
   - Government wants financial inclusion
   - Regulators encourage innovation

5. **No dominant instant P2P player** (market gap)
   - SnapScan/Zapper are merchant-focused
   - Bank transfers are slow
   - Perfect timing to capture market

**Window of opportunity: 18-24 months before competitors catch up**

---

## SLIDE 8: MARKET POTENTIAL

**South Africa (Launch Market):**
- Total payment market: R2.5 trillion/year
- Addressable market: R870B/year
  - P2P transfers: R200B
  - Merchant payments: R300B
  - Informal economy: R370B
- Target users: 35M (40M smartphone users)

**Africa (Expansion):**
- Year 5: 98M users, R9.2B revenue
- Year 10: 463M users, R136B revenue

**Comparable Markets:**
- M-Pesa (Kenya): 30M users, $5B valuation
- UPI (India): 300M users, 10B transactions/month
- Venmo (USA): 90M users, acquired for $800M

**TAM: $75B global opportunity**

---

## SLIDE 9: COMPETITION & POSITIONING

### We're NOT Competing with Consumer Apps

**Consumer Apps (Different Market):**
- SnapScan, Zapper: Merchant QR payments (~3M users, limited adoption)
- M-Pesa: Mobile money (dominant in Kenya, not in SA)
- Venmo, Cash App: P2P apps (not in Africa)

**Why We're Different:** We're infrastructure (B2B), they're apps (B2C)

### We're Competing with Payment Infrastructure

| Feature | Card Networks (Visa) | Bank Transfers | **Mari Protocol** |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Model** | B2B2C (infrastructure) | Bank-to-bank | **B2B2C (infrastructure)** |
| **Speed** | Instant | 1-3 days | **2 seconds** |
| **Offline** | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ (SMS)** |
| **Fraud** | 2-3% fraud rate | 1-2% fraud rate | **<0.1% (99.95% accuracy)** |
| **Cost** | 3% merchant fee | R5 per transfer | **R0.10 per transaction** |
| **Integration** | Complex (6-12 months) | Built-in | **Simple SDK (2-4 weeks)** |

**Our Positioning:**
1. **Infrastructure play** (like Visa, not like Venmo)
2. **B2B2C model** (banks are customers, users are end-users)
3. **Physics-based security** (unique, defensible)
4. **Offline capability** (works during load shedding)

**Competitive Moats:**
- **Network effects** (winner-takes-all, exponential growth)
- **Bank partnerships** (exclusive contracts, 12-24 months)
- **HSM infrastructure** (R85M + 18 months to build)
- **Fraud detection data** (more transactions = better models)
- **Patents** (physics seal method, 20-year protection)

**Key Insight:** We're not another payment app. We're the infrastructure layer that makes all payment apps better.
