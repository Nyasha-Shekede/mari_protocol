## SLIDE 2: ONE-LINE PITCH

**Mari is the payment protocol that works everywhere - online or offline - secured by physics, not passwords.**

---

## SLIDE 3: PURPOSE

**"We are in the business of making payments work anywhere in Africa."**

We exist to solve the fundamental problem that payments fail when internet fails. 

By using physics (motion + location + time) instead of passwords, we make payments both more secure and more accessible.

---

## SLIDE 4: PROBLEM

**Payments in Africa are broken:**

1. **Bank transfers take 1-3 days** (too slow)
2. **Card fees are 3%** (too expensive for merchants)
3. **Internet is unreliable** (load shedding 4-8 hours/day in SA)
4. **Fraud costs R500M+/year** (banks lose money)
5. **Informal economy is cash-based** (R500B/year, risky)

**The pain:** 
- Merchants can't afford card terminals
- Users can't pay during load shedding
- Banks lose money to fraud
- Informal traders carry dangerous amounts of cash

---

## SLIDE 5: SOLUTION

**Physics-secured payments that work online or offline:**

**Innovation 1: Physics Seal**
- User shakes phone to authorize payment
- Motion + GPS + timestamp = unique signature
- Cannot be faked remotely (laws of physics)
- 99.95% fraud detection accuracy

**Innovation 2: Offline Payments**
- Works via SMS when internet fails
- Detects offline mode automatically
- Perfect for load shedding and rural areas

**Result:**
- Instant (2-3 seconds vs 1-3 days)
- Cheap (R0.50 vs R5)
- Secure (99.95% fraud prevention)
- Universal (works everywhere)

---

## SLIDE 6: PRODUCT

**B2B2C Infrastructure - Not a standalone app**

**How it works:**
1. Banks integrate Mari SDK into their existing apps
2. Users never download "Mari app"
3. Users use their trusted bank app with new capabilities
4. Mari provides infrastructure, banks provide customers

**User Experience:**
```
1. Open FNB app
2. Click "Send Money"
3. Enter phone number: +27821234567
4. Enter amount: R100
5. Shake phone (physics seal)
6. Payment sent (2 seconds)
```

**Demo:** [Link to video or live demo]

**Key Point:** Mari is protocol infrastructure (like Visa), not a payment app (like Venmo).

---

## SLIDE 7: WHY NOW?

**The stars are aligning:**

1. **Load shedding crisis** (4-8 hours/day)
   - People need payments that work offline
   - Traditional solutions fail

2. **Smartphone penetration** (67% in SA)
   - Higher than Kenya when M-Pesa launched (55%)
   - Everyone has the hardware

3. **Bank fraud epidemic** (R500M+/year losses)
   - Banks desperate for better security
   - Will pay for fraud prevention

4. **Regulatory support** (SARB fintech sandbox)
   - Government wants financial inclusion
   - Regulators encourage innovation

5. **No dominant instant P2P player** (market gap)
   - SnapScan/Zapper are merchant-focused
   - Bank transfers are slow
   - Perfect timing to capture market

**Window of opportunity: 18-24 months before competitors catch up**
