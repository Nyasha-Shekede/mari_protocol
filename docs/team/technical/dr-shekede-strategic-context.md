## 1. What Mari Actually Is (Simple Explanation)

### The One-Sentence Pitch

Mari is payment infrastructure (like Visa) that uses physics-based security to enable instant, fraud-proof payments in Africa.

### The Analogy

**Mari is to payments what WhatsApp was to SMS:**
- WhatsApp didn't replace phone companies - it worked through them
- Mari doesn't replace banks - we integrate with them
- WhatsApp made messaging instant and free
- Mari makes payments instant and secure

### What We're NOT

- ❌ Not a bank (we don't hold deposits)
- ❌ Not a payment app (users use their bank's app)
- ❌ Not competing with banks (we're their infrastructure partner)
- ❌ Not a cryptocurrency (we use regular ZAR)

### What We ARE

- ✅ Payment protocol (like Visa/Mastercard network)
- ✅ Security layer (physics-based fraud prevention)
- ✅ Bank infrastructure (they integrate our technology)
- ✅ Network effect business (more banks = more valuable)

---

## 2. The Economic Problem We're Solving

### Problem 1: Payment System Inefficiency

**Current State:**
- Bank transfers take 1-3 days to settle
- Card payments cost merchants 3% (too high)
- Cash still dominates (R150B annually in SA)
- Load shedding makes internet payments unreliable

**Economic Impact:**
- Reduces economic velocity (money moves slowly)
- Excludes informal economy (R370B annually)
- Increases transaction costs (drag on GDP)
- Limits financial inclusion (20% unbanked)

**Mari's Solution:**
- Instant settlement (seconds, not days)
- Lower costs (R0.10 vs R5-10 for bank transfers)
- Offline capability (works during load shedding)
- Inclusive (works on basic smartphones)

### Problem 2: Fraud Epidemic

**Current State:**
- South African banks lose R500M+ annually to fraud
- SIM swap attacks compromise SMS OTP security
- Remote malware can initiate unauthorized transactions
- Fraud costs passed to consumers (higher fees)

**Economic Impact:**
- Reduces trust in digital payments
- Increases cost of financial services
- Systemic risk to banking sector
- Barrier to financial inclusion

**Mari's Solution:**
- Physics-based security (can't be hacked remotely)
- 80-90% fraud reduction (proven in pilot)
- R35M savings per 1M transactions
- Enables instant authorization (banks trust the security)

### Problem 3: Financial Exclusion

**Current State:**
- 20% of population unbanked (8M people)
- Informal economy operates in cash (R370B)
- No digital payment history = no credit access
- Rural areas underserved (poor connectivity)

**Economic Impact:**
- Limits economic participation
- Reduces tax collection
- Prevents wealth accumulation
- Perpetuates inequality

**Mari's Solution:**
- Low-cost payments (accessible to low-income users)
- Offline capability (works in rural areas)
- Digital payment history (enables credit access)
- Network effects (more users = more valuable)

---

## 3. How the Technology Works (Non-Technical)

### The Core Innovation: Physics Seal

**What It Is:**
When a user wants to make a payment, they shake their phone. The phone's sensors capture:
- Motion pattern (how they shake)
- Location (where they are)
- Time (when it happened)
- Device identity (which phone)

This creates a unique "physics seal" that proves:
1. User physically held the device
2. User was at specific location
3. Transaction happened at specific time
4. Cannot be replayed or faked remotely

**Why It Matters:**
- **Remote attacks impossible:** Malware can't shake a phone
- **SIM swap irrelevant:** Not tied to phone number
- **Location verification:** Detects if phone stolen
- **Replay prevention:** Each seal is one-time use

**The Analogy:**
Like a physical signature, but impossible to forge and tied to location/time. A criminal in Johannesburg can't fake a physics seal from Cape Town.

### How Banks Integrate

**Step 1:** Bank adds Mari SDK to their mobile app
**Step 2:** User enables Mari payments in their bank app
**Step 3:** User makes payment by shaking phone
**Step 4:** Mari validates physics seal and authorizes instantly
**Step 5:** Bank processes payment (money moves)

**Key Point:** Users never leave their bank's app. Mari is invisible infrastructure.

## 6. Central Bank Perspective

### What Central Banks Care About

**1. Financial Stability**
- Is the payment system resilient?
- Can it handle systemic shocks?
- Does it introduce new risks?
- How does it affect monetary policy transmission?

**Mari's Position:**
- Built on existing banking infrastructure (not disruptive)
- Reduces fraud risk (improves stability)
- Enhances payment system efficiency
- Supports SARB's financial inclusion goals

**2. Consumer Protection**
- Are users protected from fraud?
- Is there dispute resolution?
- Are fees transparent?
- Can users access their money?

**Mari's Position:**
- Physics-based security protects users
- Clear dispute resolution process
- Transparent fee structure (R0.10 per transaction)
- Instant access to funds

**3. Financial Inclusion**
- Does it expand access to financial services?
- Does it serve underserved populations?
- Does it reduce costs for low-income users?
- Does it work in rural areas?

**Mari's Position:**
- Low-cost payments (accessible to all)
- Offline capability (works in rural areas)
- Smartphone-based (no special hardware)
- Creates digital payment history (enables credit)

**4. Monetary Policy Transmission**
- Does it affect money supply?
- Does it impact interest rate transmission?
- Does it provide useful economic data?
- Does it support policy objectives?

**Mari's Position:**
- Doesn't create money (uses existing ZAR)
- Improves payment system efficiency
- Provides real-time transaction data
- Supports digitization of economy

### Lessons from Bank of England

**Your Experience Informs:**
1. How to engage with central banks (early, transparent, collaborative)
2. What concerns to anticipate (stability, consumer protection, AML)
3. How to position innovation (supporting, not disrupting)
4. What data to provide (transaction volumes, fraud rates, user complaints)

**Key Insights:**
- Central banks want innovation but fear instability
- Early engagement builds trust
- Demonstrate alignment with policy objectives
- Provide data to support decision-making
- Be patient (regulatory approval takes time)

## 9. International Expansion Strategy

### Africa Expansion Roadmap

**Phase 1: South Africa (Years 1-2)**
- Establish proof of concept
- Build regulatory relationships
- Achieve profitability
- Create case studies

**Phase 2: SADC Region (Years 3-4)**
- Botswana (stable, small market, easy entry)
- Namibia (close ties to SA, similar regulations)
- Zimbabwe (high demand, challenging regulations)

**Phase 3: East Africa (Years 4-5)**
- Kenya (large market, M-Pesa competition)
- Tanzania (growing market, less competition)
- Uganda (underserved market, high potential)

**Phase 4: West Africa (Years 5-7)**
- Nigeria (huge market, 200M population)
- Ghana (stable, growing digital payments)
- Senegal (francophone entry point)

### Regulatory Considerations by Region

**SADC (Southern African Development Community):**
- Harmonized payment regulations (easier expansion)
- Common Monetary Area (Lesotho, Namibia, Eswatini use ZAR)
- SARB credibility helps (regulatory approval in SA matters)

**EAC (East African Community):**
- M-Pesa dominance (need differentiation)
- Mobile money regulations (different from banking)
- Cross-border payment agreements (opportunity)

**ECOWAS (West Africa):**
- Fragmented regulations (country-by-country approach)
- Francophone vs. Anglophone (different systems)
- Large informal economies (high potential)

### International Expansion Challenges

**Regulatory:**
- Different regulations per country
- Lengthy approval processes
- Local partnership requirements
- Data localization laws

**Operational:**
- Currency conversion (multi-currency support)
- Local banking integrations (different APIs)
- Language localization (15+ African languages)
- Infrastructure reliability (varies by country)

**Strategic:**
- Local competition (M-Pesa, others)
- Cultural differences (payment behaviors)
- Economic instability (currency fluctuations)
- Political risk (regulatory changes)
