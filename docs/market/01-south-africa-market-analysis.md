## The Opportunity: What's Broken?

### Problem 1: Bank Transfers Are Slow

**Current state:**
```
User wants to send R100 to friend
    ↓
Opens banking app
    ↓
Enters account number (16 digits)
    ↓
Enters branch code (6 digits)
    ↓
Confirms payment
    ↓
Waits 1-3 days for settlement
    ↓
Friend receives money

Total time: 1-3 days
User experience: Terrible
```

**Market size:**
- P2P transfers: R200 billion/year
- Average transaction: R500
- Total transactions: 400 million/year
- Average fee: R5
- Total fees: R2 billion/year

**Mari's opportunity:**
- Instant settlement (2 seconds vs 1-3 days)
- Phone number only (vs account number + branch code)
- Lower fees (R0.50 vs R5)
- Better UX (shake vs complicated forms)

**Potential capture: 50% of P2P market = R100 billion/year**

---

### Problem 2: Card Fees Are Too High

**Current state:**
```
Merchant sells R100 item
    ↓
Customer pays with card
    ↓
Card network charges 3% fee
    ↓
Merchant receives R97
    ↓
Merchant loses R3 per transaction

For small merchants (spaza shops, street vendors):
- Margins: 10-20%
- Card fees: 3%
- Profit: 7-17% (significant hit)
```

**Market size:**
- Merchant card payments: R1.5 trillion/year
- Average fee: 3%
- Total fees: R45 billion/year

**Mari's opportunity:**
- Lower fees (1% vs 3%)
- Instant settlement (vs 3 days)
- No POS terminal needed (phone only)
- Physics seal = no chargebacks

**Potential capture: 20% of merchant market = R300 billion/year**

---

### Problem 3: Informal Economy Is Cash-Based

**Current state:**
```
Informal economy: R500 billion/year (20% of GDP)

Examples:
- Spaza shops (corner stores)
- Street vendors
- Taxi drivers
- Domestic workers
- Freelancers

Problem: Cash-based
- No digital payment acceptance
- Security risk (robbery)
- No transaction records
- Hard to access credit
```

**Why they don't use digital payments:**
- Card terminals too expensive (R2,000 + R200/month)
- Bank transfers too slow (1-3 days)
- Cash is instant and free

**Mari's opportunity:**
- Free to accept payments (no terminal)
- Instant settlement (like cash)
- Physics seal = secure
- Transaction records = access to credit

**Potential capture: 30% of informal economy = R150 billion/year**
