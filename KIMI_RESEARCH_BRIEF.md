## 📋 What is Mari Protocol?

### The Elevator Pitch
Mari is a universal payment protocol that enables instant, secure, and low-cost digital payments with or without internet. Built for Africa with physics-based fraud prevention (99.95% accuracy) and bank-grade settlement.

### The Innovation
**Physics-Based Security:**
- User shakes phone to authorize payment
- Motion sensors + GPS + timestamp = unique signature
- Cannot be faked remotely (laws of physics)
- Blocks 80% of fraud (remote malware)

**Offline Payments:**
- Works via SMS when internet fails
- Perfect for load shedding (4-8 hours/day in SA)
- Works on 2G signal
- No data plan needed

**Instant Settlement:**
- 2-3 seconds (vs 1-3 days for bank transfers)
- Just phone number (no account numbers)
- R0.50 fee (vs R5 for banks)

### The Business Model
**B2B2C Infrastructure:**
- Banks integrate Mari SDK into their apps
- Users never download "Mari app"
- Mari provides infrastructure, banks provide customers
- Revenue: R0.10 per transaction + bank licensing fees

### The Market
**South Africa (Launch Market):**
- 40M smartphone users (67% penetration)
- R870B addressable market
- Year 5 target: 5M users, R652M-R2.2B revenue

**Africa (Expansion):**
- Year 5: 98M users, R9.2B revenue
- Year 10: 463M users, R136B revenue

### Current Status
- ✅ Working prototype (Android app)
- ✅ Physics seal algorithm (tested)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (50+ pages)
- 🔄 Patent application (in progress)
- 🔄 Bank partnerships (in discussion)
- 🔄 Regulatory approval (SARB sandbox)
